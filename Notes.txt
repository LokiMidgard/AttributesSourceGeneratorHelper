good news is i now have the extension go get the proper strings for the parameters (tocamelcase)
Looks like i have to do the following now:

if nothing was needed, the extra class will be the properties (if any)

on the other hand, if there was no properties, then nothing would be added.
for the first one, do the glbal usings


next major task:

figure out how to remove the attributes from the string being returned. (maybe do this part first).

the extra helpers has to be a separate class now.

the global usings will be the first one that had at least one property.


looks like one major issue.
the one major issue is the edited version has to be done separately.

this means requires rethinking.

needs to learn how to add to code being used for somebody else.

attempt to make as partial class.

hopefully will just work.

iffy part is how its appended to string.

once i can figure out how to do constructors that another source generator can use, then can move on and figure out what else is needed.

good news is did figured out how to do constructors that another source generator uses.

has to also create a method.
